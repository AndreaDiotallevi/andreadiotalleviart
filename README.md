## Description

This is a React single page application, showcasing my [generative art](https://github.com/AndreaDiotallevi/generative-art) experimentations.

## Getting Started

* Clone this repository and change into it
* Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed
* Install all the dependencies with ```npm install```

## How to Run the Tests

To run all the tests type ```npm test```

## How to Run the App

Start the local server with ```npm start```

## Technologies Used

- Main technologies:
  * [React](https://reactjs.org/): a JavaScript library we used to build the user interface and gather data from external APIs.
  * [CSS Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox): the flexible box layout module makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.
  
- Testing frameworks:
  * [Jest](https://jestjs.io/): a JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.
  * [Enzyme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/enzyme): a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to test the React Components' output.
  
## Continuous Integration

[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/): tool for automating the development process quickly, safely, and at scale.
